Since 2009/2010, I have had one version or the other of my CV in LaTeX. In the last 5 years of my academic career, I now have a version that I like for keeping a record of papers, grants, teaching, awards, service, etc. You can view my most recent CV on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cxmzjdzskvrr#54e289). Feel free to copy and modify as needed. Hopefully, soon, I will have a template.

I love the look of the [Libertine](https://www.tug.org/FontCatalogue/linuxlibertine/) font family, which gives the CV that classic professional feel.

I still have several updates I would like to make, so this is definitely a work in progress.
