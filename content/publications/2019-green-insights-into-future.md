The MIT Energy Initiative's (MITEI's) three-year Mobility of the Future study explored the major factors that affect the evolution of personal mobility from 2020 to 2050. Using a scenario-based approach, the diverse study team of MIT faculty, researchers, and students examined how different factors shape the future of personal mobility at different scales, from global and national markets to policy and mobility choices at the city and individual levels. This report presents results and findings to help stakeholders anticipate and navigate the challenges that lie ahead. The report includes detailed findings on five areas of influence on the future landscape for personal mobility: (1) The potential impact of climate change policies on global fleet composition, fuel consumption, fuel prices, and economic output; (2) The outlook for vehicle ownership and travel, with a focus on the world’s two largest light-duty vehicle markets—the U.S. and China; (3) Characteristics of alternative vehicle powertrains and fuels that could affect their future market share; (4) Infrastructure considerations for charging and fueling, particularly as they affect future demand for electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; and (5) The future of personal mobility in urban areas, with a focus on the potentially disruptive role of autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing services.
