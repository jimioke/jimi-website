In this work, we applied Scenario Discovery (SD) to explore emission reduction potentials and identify decarbonization pathways over multiple sectors, using the New Haven Milford Metropolitan statistical area as a case study in regional planning. We first generated a diverse set of future emission states using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), and then applied Gaussian Mixture Analysis to cluster outcomes based on emission percentage changes between 2021 and 2050 (EPC) and cumulative emissions percentage change (CEPC). This analysis identified four decarbonization scenarios: \textit{Mild}, \textit{Moderate}, \textit{Deep}, and \textit{Near Net-Zero}. We further examine the pathways associated with these decarbonization scenarios and the parameter combinations that could drive progress toward the decarbonization targets, as well as the relative importance shifts of these activity parameters under different target-year assumptions. The results indicate that achieving \textit{Near-Net Zero} requires more than half of the total change in electrification rates and fuel economy (MPG), as well as in truck vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and commercial emissions, along with an earlier shift in these changes. In addition, the share of residential contributions to overall emissions actually increases throughout the planning horizon, indicating the need to prioritize the management of residential energy consumption.  Furthermore, we trained an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to predict EPC and CEPC. XGBoost model revealed the most relevant factors in each scenario. In particular, residential natural gas consumption is a key driver of emissions reduction in \textit{Near-Net Zero}, followed by commercial emissions, highlighting an effort to improve the efficiency of residential and commercial building energy consumption.
