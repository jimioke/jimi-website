Of 684 urban counties in the United States, only 307 (45%) have publicly available bicycle maps online. From these maps, we observed five features: Level of Infrastructure, Amenity Locations, Level of Stress, Transit Locations, and Interactive features. Using these binary data, we clustered the counties via a Bernoulli mixture model to obtain a typology of three map types. The Minimal type largely features level of stress information, which indicates route difficulty or cycling comfort. The Moderate type mainly features level of infrastructure. Finally, the Complete type features the aforementioned indicators in addition to displaying the locations of transit stops and amenities. Using socioeconomic and mode share predictors from the American Community Survey for the 684 counties, along with map-related features, we fitted three XGBoost models to predict bicycle mode share. Our models indicate that map availability has a positive impact of bicycle use. Second, Complete maps are associated with lower bicycle usage, while the reverse is true for Minimal maps. Finally, of the 5 map features identified, Level of Infrastructure and Transit Locations are the most relevant in predicting bicycle usage but they have a negative association. These findings may indicate that simpler maps are more effective or that comprehensive maps may not be as effective as thought in increasing bicycling. Overall, this work lays a foundation for future planning and analyses for better bicycle maps.
