Global offshore wind development is rapidly expanding, with lease areas exceeding 400 square kilometers, leading to technical, economic, and environmental challenges in seabed characterization. Revolutionizing seabed characterization through integrated, cross-disciplinary scientific approaches presents an opportunity to reshape the offshore energy industry’s data requirements, collection, interpretation, and integration processes. Significant opportunities for transformative innovation lie in the development of more intelligent site characterization methods that incorporate data science-informed decision-making. The NSF-funded workshop Advancing Integrated Seabed Characterization for Clean Energy Transition (ASCENT) was held in November 2024, bringing together a geographically diverse group of international stakeholders, including academics, offshore wind developers, consultants, contractors, and government regulators. The workshop aimed to promote transformative, cross-disciplinary innovation in integrated seabed characterization methods. It focused on improving the quantification of geodata uncertainty and enhancing ground model reliability. Keynote presentations, panel discussions, and breakout sessions provided insights into regulatory perspectives on project data requirements, challenged the current state of practice in data collection and interpretation, and advanced the state-of-the-art in data integration and data science applications. This paper presents the workshop’s motivation, key outcomes, and future opportunities identified to reduce the carbon footprint and the economic and environmental costs of offshore renewable energy development.
