We present a comprehensive accounting and scenario discovery framework for sector-specific regional greenhouse gas emissions. Three regions in Connecticut, namely Bridgeport, Hartford, and New Haven, served as case studies. Our inventory approach combines bottom-up and top-down approaches, relying on readily available data sources. We also fitted autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to project near-term emissions across all sectors in each region. The models indicate that absent any interventions, current emissions trends will remain unchanged. Sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of truck mileage and grid emissions factors in emissions. Critically, we then apply the data-driven scenario discovery method to elicit nine robust decarbonization pathways at the mild, moderate and deep level. Our results show that deep decarbonization is attainable but requires a concerted multi-sector approach focused on mobility, grid emissions, commercial emissions and residential fossil fuel use. We expect that this framework will be easily deployable to other regions, serving as a useful tool to identify key areas of focus for equitable and effective emissions mitigation planning efforts.
